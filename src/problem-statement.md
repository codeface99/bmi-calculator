# Problem

Create a simple BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator should accept a user's weight in kilograms and height in centimeters as input, and calculate their BMI based on the formula:

    BMI = Weight (kg) / Height (m) * Height (m)

Display the calculated BMI and categorize it into one of the following categories:

- Underweight (BMI < 18.5)
- Normal weight (18.5 ≤ BMI < 24.9)
- Overweight (25 ≤ BMI < 29.9)
- Obese (BMI ≥ 30)

Ensure inputs are valid numbers and greater than zero. Display an error message for invalid inputs.
